\# Fashion MNIST Classification with Fully Connected Neural Networks

This Google Colab notebook contains Python code for performing classification

on the Fashion MNIST dataset using fully connected neural network models.

Here's a brief overview of the notebook's content:

\## Importing Libraries

The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries including TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy, and pandas.

\## Load, Discover, and Preprocess the Data

- The Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded using TensorFlow Datasets.
- The sample counts in the training and testing datasets are validated.
- Data normalization is applied to scale pixel values to the range [0, 1].
- Twenty random images from the test dataset are displayed for visualization.
- The distribution of labels in both training and test datasets is plotted to ensure balanced distribution.

\## Model Development and Evaluation

- Five different models are developed and evaluated.
- Each model is trained and evaluated with different configurations.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss are recorded and compared across models.
- Techniques like dropout regularization and grid search are employed to enhance model performance.

\## Overall Evaluation

- The accuracies and losses of all models are compared.
- The best performing model is identified and its performance is visualized.
- Predictions are made on a subset of test images using the best model, and the results are displayed.
